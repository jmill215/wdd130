    <h2>Jacob Miller</h2>
    <h2>Jake</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone, my name is Jacob Miller. I am 24 years old, from Utah, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelors degree in Software Development. I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints my entire life. My hobbies are drawing, learning about technology, and music. The drawing hobby, however, is still at a basic level. </p>
    <p>My current job is working at an eCommerce bike shop. I am in charge of shipping items to customers, as well as unpackaging deliveries to be sent out later. I chose to pursue a Software Development degree in order to secure employment that is not as physically taxing, and to be able to work more with technology. I always liked tinkering around with software when I was young, and wanted to take employment that would reflect that affinity for technology. In regards to other areas of my life, still in the dating phase, with scheduling for activities of that nature being very limited due to increased work/family obligations in the last year.</p>
    <p>If anyone wants help on assignments, I have updated my contact information in I-Learn, and will check my canvas inbox regularly if anything is sent through there. Thank you for looking at my introduction, and I look forward to getting to know you all!</p>
